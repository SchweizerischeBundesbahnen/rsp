### Load Experiment Data

```{python}
experiment_base_directory = BASELINE_DATA_FOLDER

experiment_of_interest = 342
agent_of_interest = 0
```

Extract data and aggregate plotting data

```{python}
experiment_data_directory = f'{experiment_base_directory}/{EXPERIMENT_DATA_SUBDIRECTORY_NAME}'

experiment_results_list, experiment_results_analysis_list = load_and_expand_experiment_results_from_data_folder(
    experiment_data_folder_name=experiment_data_directory,
    experiment_ids=[experiment_of_interest],
)
exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest: ExperimentResults = experiment_results_list[0]
exp_results_analysis_of_experiment_of_interest = experiment_results_analysis_list[0]
agent_of_interest = exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.experiment_parameters.re_schedule_parameters.malfunction_agent_id

```

```{python}
resource_occupations_for_all_scopes = extract_resource_occupations_for_all_scopes(experiment_result=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest)
plotting_information: PlottingInformation = extract_plotting_information(
    schedule_as_resource_occupations=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes.schedule,
    grid_depth=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.experiment_parameters.infra_parameters.width,
    sorting_agent_id=agent_of_interest
)
trajectories_for_all_scopes = extract_trajectories_for_all_scopes(
    schedule_as_resource_occupations_all_scopes=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes,
    plotting_information=plotting_information
)
```

### Analyze Experiment Data

Compute the propagation wave from the malfunction with no re-scheduling. We compute how the malfunction would propagate in the schedule if no re-scheduling actions are taken. This means that between two consecutive trains on the same resource, the delay propagates if their temporal distance is smaller than the duration of the delay. The delay passed on to the next consists of the difference between the duration of the delay and the time between trains.

```{python}
transmission_chains = extract_transmission_chains_from_schedule(
    malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction,
    occupations=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes.schedule
)
distance_matrix, minimal_depth = compute_disturbance_propagation_graph(
    transmission_chains=transmission_chains,
    number_of_trains=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.experiment_parameters.infra_parameters.number_of_agents
)

changed_trajectories, changed_agents_dict = get_difference_in_time_space_trajectories(
                        base_trajectories=trajectories_for_all_scopes.schedule,
                        target_trajectories=trajectories_for_all_scopes.offline_delta)
true_positives = resource_occpuation_from_transmission_chains(transmission_chains,changed_agents_dict)
unchanged_agents = {}
for agent in changed_agents_dict:
    unchanged_agents[agent] = not changed_agents_dict[agent]
false_positives = resource_occpuation_from_transmission_chains(transmission_chains,unchanged_agents)
true_positives_trajectories = trajectories_from_resource_occupations_per_agent({0:true_positives},plotting_information)
false_positives_trajectories = trajectories_from_resource_occupations_per_agent({0:false_positives},plotting_information)
```

### Malfunction spread without interventions from re-scheduling algorithm

Visualize the propagation of the malfunction in the schedule. Only forward propagation is considered and no re-scheduling is assumed. This illustrates the extent of the malfunction if no actions are taken.

```{python}
print(f"agent_of_interest={agent_of_interest}")
print_situation_overview(
    resource_occupations_for_all_scopes=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes,
    malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction
)
```

```{python}
plot_time_resource_trajectories(title="Malfunction Propagation in Schedule",
                                trajectories=trajectories_for_all_scopes.schedule,
                                plotting_information=plotting_information,
                                malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction,
                                true_positives=true_positives_trajectories,
                                false_positives=false_positives_trajectories)
```

Spatially the influence of the malfunction would have spread according to the following plot

```{python}
plot_delay_propagation_2d(plotting_information=plotting_information,
                          malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction,
                          schedule_as_resource_occupations=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes.offline_delta,
                          delay_information=exp_results_analysis_of_experiment_of_interest.lateness_per_agent_offline_delta,
                          depth_dict=minimal_depth)
```

### Re-scheduling to prevent spread of malfunction

Given the actions of the re-scheduling algorithm, the spread can be limited both in time and space. The figures below show the actual spread after the malfunction when actions were taken to stay close to the initial schedule

```{python}
plot_time_resource_trajectories(title="Influenced Trains after re-scheduling",
                                trajectories=changed_trajectories,
                                plotting_information=plotting_information,
                                malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction)
```

The spatial spread of the malfunction can be seen below. The arrows indicate direction of travel, the thickness of the arrow indicates the total delay of an agent. The colors show the depth of influence from the initial agent, meaning if it was directly or indirectly influenced.

```{python}
plot_delay_propagation_2d(plotting_information=plotting_information,
                          malfunction=exp_results_of_experiment_of_interest.malfunction,
                          schedule_as_resource_occupations=resource_occupations_for_all_scopes.offline_delta,
                          delay_information=exp_results_analysis_of_experiment_of_interest.lateness_per_agent_offline_delta,
                          depth_dict=minimal_depth,
                          changed_agents=changed_agents_dict)
```

Figure below shows the histogram of the delay times, giving us a great overview of how strongly trains where affected by the malfunciton

```{python}
plot_histogram_from_delay_data(experiment_results_analysis=exp_results_analysis_of_experiment_of_interest)
```

The below figure shows the propagation of the malfunction within the schedule, when there are no actions taken. The progation is projected to show the influence from an agent to the next agent.

Given that the influence from one agent to the next can follow different delay propagaions through the system and we only plot the lowest influence depth recorded, connected agents might have larger than 1 difference in influence depth.

Furthermore we don't show backwards propagations. E.g. we don't show connections from deeper influence agents to lower ones. We chose this in such a way to keep visualization simple. Also we believe that the shallower propagation of the disturbance has a more imminent effect than the deeper ones.

The figure below is a simplified projection which should only help to visualize how different agents have vastly different effects on the propagation of the delay

```{python}
plot_delay_propagation_graph(minimal_depth = minimal_depth,
        distance_matrix = distance_matrix, changed_agents= changed_agents_dict)
```
