"""Analysis of the experiment data for hypothesis one.

Hypothesis 1:
    We can compute good recourse actions, i.e., an adapted plan within the time budget,
    if all the variables are fixed, except those related to services that are affected by the
    disruptions implicitly or explicitly.

Hypothesis 2:
    Machine learning can predict services that are affected by disruptions implicitly or
    explicitly. Hypothesis 3: If hypothesis 2 is true, in addition, machine
    learning can predict the state of the system in the next time period
    after re-scheduling.
